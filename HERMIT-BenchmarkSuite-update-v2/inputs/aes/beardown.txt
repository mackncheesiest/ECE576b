All Hail, Arizona (Alma Mater)
Words by Ted Monro
Music by Dorothy Heighton Monro
All hail, Arizona! Thy colors Red and Blue
Stand as a symbol - of our love for you. 
All hail, Arizona! To thee we'll be true
We'll watch o'er and keep you, All hail! All hail!
 
Fight Wildcats, Fight

Hail Arizona Wildcats
Fighting for old UA. 
A raging team of Wildcats
Growling for the fray
There's not a team can stop them
When the ball goes into play
So Fight! Team! 
Fight with all your might
And win today.

Fight Wildcats, Fight for
Arizona
We're with you ever staunch
And true
This day we hail you and we
cheer you
They can't defeat the Red
And Blue
Circle the ends and crash
Through center
Hit hard and gain on ev'ry play
Fight Wildcats! 
Fight! Fight! Fight! 
We'll win today!
